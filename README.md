# Mystery Box Game – Frontend Web Project

# Deployement : 

## Description:

The Mystery Box Game is a fun and interactive number-guessing game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, the player must unlock a mystery box by guessing a secret number between 1 and 50. The player has 10 attempts to discover the hidden number, with feedback provided after each guess to guide them — whether the guess is too high or too low.

When the player guesses the correct number, the mystery box reveals the number, the background changes with a celebration effect, and the current score is compared against the highest score achieved so far. If the player runs out of attempts, the game ends with a "Game Over" message and the box is locked again.

## The game features:

- A clean and modern user interface.

- Emoji-based feedback to enhance user engagement.

- Dynamic styling to reflect game state (win/loss).

- A high score tracker that updates automatically.

- Responsive layout that works well across screen sizes.

This project is a great way to demonstrate your knowledge of DOM manipulation, event handling, conditionals, and basic game logic. It's also an excellent starter project to extend with features like difficulty levels, timer-based challenges, or sound effects.
